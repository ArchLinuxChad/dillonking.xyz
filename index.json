And UFW just so happens to be easy to configure and is an awesome firewall this is why I have chosen it for this guide. Note there many other firewalls with one of them being firewalld.\nInstalling UFW # Ubuntu/Debian. # sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y sudo install ufw -y Although if you are on Ubuntu, UFW may already be installed.\nArch # sudo pacman --noconfirm -Syu sudo pacman --needed --noconfirm -S ufw Fedora # NOTE: By default Fedora uses firewalld so you can use the following commands to remove it if you wish. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANYONE BREAKING THEIR SYSTEM!.\nsudo systemctl disable firewalld.service --now sudo dnf remove firewalld -y Now you can install UFW\nsudo dnf upgrade -y sudo dnf install ufw Setting Default Policys # With UFW you can set default policys and then set specific rules for example allowing a certain port.\nsudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw default allow outgoing This will by default deny incoming requests and allow outgoing requests, this is generally good practice.\nEnabling and Disabling ports # Enabling # I use hugo to make this website, and to use the hugo server I have to enable port 1313. To do this the command is.\nsudo ufw allow 1313 Disabling # Then to disable this port type.\nsudo ufw deny 1313 In Conclusion # Hopefully this article has given you a good base level of knowledge on how to use UFW. You can now secure your system with a firewall. Hope you found this article useful.\n","date":"16 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/ufw/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is UFW?","title":"A guide to UFW","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/networks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Networks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/security/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Security","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bash/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bash","type":"tags"},{"content":" ArchLinuxChad/bashfetch Shell 0 0 I am not a programmer # I would like to start this post off by saying that I am not a programmer and have never claimed to be, although I sometimes code for fun.\nWritten in Bash # Because I am not programmer but love and use Linux everyday, my knowledge of Bash scripting has become quite good.

I do have quite a good knowledge of Python, but Bash still seemed like the right choice here.\nWhat does Bashfetch do? # Bashfetch, grabs basic system information just like neofetch. But it is quicker than neofetch as it only prints out one ascii logo and not a different one depending on the distro. It also allows you to customize the output without the config file and with an interactive menu written in bash by typing.\nbashfetch --config Although I am still Developing this CLI app so if you use it don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to work flawlessly.
